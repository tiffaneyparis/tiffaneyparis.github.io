        <p>I enjoy the simple monochromatic style of this site. It's classic, 
        elegant, and not overly complicated. It stays blue throughout, until clicking the links, 
        then it comes to life by adding the proper, vibrant color. </p></li>

        <p>I appreciate the original drawings on this one, almost like a cut and paste and 
        cartoon feel. After entering the site, rows of boxes with muted colors show a
        representation of the alphabet, keeping with the almost elementary style. They have 
        simple illustrations, and it draws you in to wanting to know what's behind each box.</p></li>

       <p>This site has a retro feel at first glance, with the black and white intro page. 
       The navigation is easy and not too complicated. Scrolling down brings up colored boxes 
       with small animations, to keep you interested in clicking them. Clicking on the links
       brings more great design element, and stays somewhat uniform. The pictures are a bit on the 
           large side, but doesn't take too long to load.</p></li>

       <p>What I really like the way this site is layed out. The odd typography grabs you, and as you
       scroll down scrolling alternates between horizontal and back down again. The pictures are bright and
       clear, and beautiful. The layout is arranged in a uniform and interesting way. Also, the dropdown
       menu on the right lets you skip ahead to pick where you want to go in the navigation.</p></li>

       <p>I really enjoy the youthfulness of this site. It's not only professional, but inovative with an inspired
       layout. On the portfolio site, the boxes seem to rotate around like a ferris wheel. The colors are vibrant and it's easy 
       to navigate.</p></li>

    <p id="testing1"> QUESTIONS:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p id="testing2">On the fixed group site, they use pictures from popular movies, such as the Karate Kid. They alter them by adding
  cartoon eyes and silly elements, but how do they get away with using those pics? Aren't they protected by copyright? Or
  is it all fair game on the internet?
    </p></li> 
 
  <li> <p id="testing3">
      When scrolling down, some of the pages not only do so, but scroll left, up and right. How is this achieved? Is this 
  possible with HTML or does it have to be java script?</p>
   </p></li>
