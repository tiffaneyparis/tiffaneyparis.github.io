        <p>I enjoy the simple monochromatic style of this site. It's classic, elegant, and not overly complicated. It stays blue throughout, until clicking the links, then it comes to life by adding the proper, vibrant color. </p>

        <p>I appreciate the original drawings on this one, almost like a cut and paste and cartoon feel. After entering the site, rows of boxes with muted colors show a representation of the alphabet, keeping with the almost elementary style. They have simple illustrations, and it draws you in to wanting to know what's behind each box.</p>

       <p>This site has a retro feel at first glance, with the black and white intro page. The navigation is easy and not too complicated. Scrolling down brings up colored boxes with small animations, to keep you interested in clicking them. Clicking on the links brings more great design element, and stays somewhat uniform. The pictures are a bit on the large side, but doesn't take too long to load.</p></li>
